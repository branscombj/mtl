## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the team data in the experiments tile.
2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.
3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## Check the name of your team data file in Explorer
1. In session 3, we used our team data UI and clicked "Get Team Data Table for Sim UI" to produce our team data for simulation. 
2. Let's now go back to mtl.how/data in an Internet Explorer window to check the name of our team data file.
3. The team data file for simulation is in our team folder, in the team_data_sim folder. Copy the name of the team data file.

## Log in to the sim UI in Chrome

4. Log in to the Sim UI.

+ Open a new browser window in Google Chrome and go to mtl.how/sim.

+ Enter your login credentials and click the "Login" button.

+ A box instructing you to *Please select a World* will appear. If you are working collaboratively with your team in *MTL* please select your team world denoted by "team" in the title of the world. If you are exploring the Sim UI on your own, please select your individual world denoted by "ind" in the title of the world. Click "Select World."

+ Note: Be aware that this is a responsive web design, meaning that it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions. For example, if you use your browser control to reduce the window size, the sim UI will adjust to stack these sections vertically instead of showing them side by side. Similarly, if you are logged in on a smartphone or other device, it might look different to you.

5. Orient yourself to the home page (Team name, navigation icons, player name, welcome text, sections with blue headers). Open the Team Data Menu Maintenance section and click Add. Paste the name of your team data file into the box and click Save.

6. Start a New Session

+ Select the module your team decided to use. 

+ Select the team data you want to use.

+ * For CC & MM, you need to select your Learning Mode before hitting Play.  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/learning_mode.gif)

+ Click Play.

7. Orient yourself to the Main Page of the Sim UI (same information and buttons at top; 3 sections with blue headers - one showing the module and team data selected in its header; the others headed Outputs and Text and Experiments).

![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/sim_ui_sections.gif)

8. Drag or minimize the Text section and expand the Experiments section by clicking in the blue bar. Click on the "i" in the red circle next to Team Data and read the “i” information for the Team Data table.

+ What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?

+ How do the values in this table strike you? Do they line up with how you think things really are?

9. Look for some of the Team Data table variables in the system diagram at the left.

10. Log out of the Sim UI
